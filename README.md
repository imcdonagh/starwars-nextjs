## Overview

This is my first project using React, as well as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The project has been built to complete the [Lifeway coding challenge](https://github.com/LifewayIT/corinth-code-challenge).

This project has been bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

<b>Note:</b> This project was built using Node 16.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
